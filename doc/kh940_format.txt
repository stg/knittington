== BROTHER ELECTROKNIT KH940 FLOPPY FILE/MEMORY STRUCTURE ============

The machine uses the first 32 sectors on a floppy for storage.
For the entirety of this document, the contents of these sectors
are treated as a single coherent 32kB chunk of binary data with
big-endian format where applicable.

Note that this is not likely an actual file format, rather a binary
dump of all contents in the external RAM memory of the machine.

* When writing about offsets, they are from LAST_BYTE (end of file),
    Example: The file address for offset of 0x0120 would be
             0x7EDF = 0x7FFF - 0x0120

** When writing about alternatives, it means that contents is not
     entirely classified, and could be any of several alternatives.
   Further investigation was not warranted because knowing the
     exact specification is not necessary to build a functional
     disk image.

Offset    Bytes        Content

0x0000     686         PATTERN_LIST

  Contains array of *up to* 98 pattern descriptors.
  Unused items are filled with 0x55 except for FINHDR which
    also needs XX=0 and PTN_NUM=next unused id.
    
  Patterns are not always stored in linear order, ie the list
  may be 901, 904, 902, 903. This happens when patterns are
  deleted in the machine.

       Content         Address (Offset* from header)
  /---------------\ <- 0x0000
  |  Header 901   |
  \---------------/ <- 0x0006

  /---------------\ <- 0x0007
  |  Header 902   |
  \---------------/ <- 0x000D

  /---------------\ <- 0x000E
  |    FINHDR     |
  \---------------/ <- 0x0014

  /---------------\ <- 0x0015 <- CONTROL_DATA 0x10 points here
        . . .
        . . .
  | Unused memory |
  \---------------/ <- 0x02AD

  Each entry is 7 bytes:

  /  DATA_OFFSET  \ /  HEIGHT   \/   WIDTH   \ /XX\/  PTN_NUM  \
  OOOOOOOO-OOOOOOOO-HHHHHHHH-HHHHWWWW-WWWWWWWW-0000NNNN-NNNNNNNN
  \byte 0/ \byte 1/ \byte 2/ \byte 3/ \byte 4/ \byte 5/ \byte 6/

  DATA_OFFSET
    Format: Binary 16bit unsigned
    Data:   Offset* to last byte of pattern data

  HEIGHT
    Format: BCD 3nibbles/digits
    Data:   Heigh/number of rows

  WIDTH
    Format: BCD 3nibbles/digits
    Data:   Width/number of stitches

  XX
    Always a 0x0 nibble

  PTN_NUM
    Format: BCD 3nibbles/digits
    Data:   Pattern number 0x901 to 0x998


0x02AE   31794       PATTERN_MEMORY

  Pattern memory is arranged much as a stack and is written backwards
    so that the first pattern has it's last byte in location 0x7EDF.

  Example:

       Content         Address (Offset* from header)
  /---------------\ <- 0x02AE
        . . .
        . . .
  | Unused memory |
  \---------------/ <- 0x7ECF

  /---------------\ <- 0x7ED0
  |  Pattern 902  |
  \---------------/ <- 0x7EDB  (0x0124)

  /---------------\ <- 0x7EDC
  |  Pattern 901  |
  \---------------/ <- 0x7EDF  (0x0120)

  There MAY be gaps between patterns read from the machine so do not
    expect patterns to be arranged end-to-end: USE THE POINTERS!

  Unused memory is filled with either 0x55 or 0xAA.

  Each pattern is divided into two sections, arranged as:

  /---------------\
  |  PatternDATA  |
  \---------------/

  /---------------\
  |  PatternMEMO  |
  \---------------/ <- Offset* points here

  MEMO

    Each row of the pattern may have a number assigned to it but
    it is not significant for operation, consider it meta-data.

    Each such number requires one nibble for every row, ie HEIGHT/2.
    This is rounded to the nearest byte, hence a pattern
    containing 7 rows will have 4 bytes of MEMO data.
    A pattern with 10 rows will have 5 bytes of MEMO data.

    This can be calculated as:
    ceil(height/2) // where ceil() is round upwards

    Write as: 0x00

    Memo encoding nibbles:
       0   = OFF
       1-9 = 1-9
       A-E = 0-4 blinking
       F   = OFF

  DATA

    Each row of the pattern requires WIDTH bits for storage and
    this is rounded up to the nearest nibble by padding it with
    0-bits until the number of bits is a multiple of 4.

    A pattern that has 7 stitches will therefore require 2 bytes
    per row. One that has 9 stiches will require 2.5 bytes per row.

    This means that rows may not be aligned on byte boundaries.

    Patterns are stored top-down, right-left.
    This means the pattern is flipped right to left compared to the
    actual knitted design once completed.

    The number of bytes used to store data can be calculated as:
    ceil(ceil(width/4)*height/2) // where ceil() is round upwards

    The layout is best described via examples:
    0 = pad bits       (binary 0)
    X = stitch bits    (binary 1)
    - = no stitch bits (binary 0)

    Example 1 - 4x4
    ----         Row 0:   0x0
    -XX-         Row 1:   0x6
    -XX-         Row 2:   0x6
    ----         Row 3:   0x0
    Byte data (hex): 06 60


    Example 2 - 6x5
    00X----X     Row 0:   0x21
    00------     Row 1:   0x00
    00--XX--     Row 2:   0x0C
    00X----X     Row 3:   0x21
    00-XXXX-     Row 4:   0x1E
    Byte data (hex): 21 00 0C 21 1E

    Example 3 - 9x9
    0000         Padding: 0x0
    000XXXXXXXXX Row 0:   0x1FF
    000X-------X Row 1:   0x101
    000X-XXXXX-X Row 2:   0x17D
    000X-X---X-X Row 3:   0x145
    000X-X-X-X-X Row 4:   0x155
    000X-X---X-X Row 5:   0x145
    000X-XXXXX-X Row 6:   0x17D
    000X-------X Row 7:   0x101
    000XXXXXXXXX Row 8:   0x1FF
    Byte data (hex): 01 FF 10 11 7D 14 51 55 14 51 7D 10 11 FF

    Note for example 3 that there is a nibble of padding before the
    design because the design does not round up to an even byte.
